# memory-game

### Description
Based off of the mini-project for Coursera's Intro to Interactive Programming in Python, I am recreating the classic Memory card game.

### Implementation
Instead of SimpleGUI, I will be creating the game using the more commonly used GUI package Tkinter.
I will also be implementing OOP rather than the original function-based template provided by the course.
